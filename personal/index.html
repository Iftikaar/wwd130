            <h2>Side quests</h2>
            <p>There are many quests in The Witcher 3, and the majority of those are glorious side quests. Most all side quests have a certain recommended level, and many are available only under certain conditions. Some affect other side quests in the area too. Take a look at our walkthrough guides below to navigate each location's unique quests.

            <h2>Horse races</h2>
            <p>Horse Races
                Doing horse races is well worth your time! The saddlebags you earn will let you carry up to 160 items in your inventory, the racing saddles will give your horse more stamina, and with the blinders your horse won't get frightened by monsters so quickly. You will also earn a great deal of money for very little work (the 7th race alone gives you 700 coins and takes only 3 minutes). It's a good way to get some cash early in the game.
