            <h1>Open world</h1>


            <h2>Kingdoms</h2>
            <p>The Four Kingdoms (or The Great Kingdoms, as in The World of the Witcher) is a collective term used to refer to the ensemble of the significant countries prior to Second Northern War with Nilfgaard. 
                The hub of the lands of the North is composed of four largest kingdoms â€” Nilfgaard, Skellige, Redania, and Aedirn.
                 They are the prime players in the great game of politics and war that decides the fate of kingdoms and dynasties.</p>

            

            <h2>Nilfgaardian Empire</h2>
            <p>The Nilfgaardian Empire (Ceas'raet[1] in Nilfgaardian language) is the most powerful empire in the history of the known world. 
                It is located in the southern part of the Continent and boasts both a thriving economy and a strong, well-trained army with talented commanders. 
                It has expanded mostly through the conquest of foreign countries, which were then turned into provinces of the Empire. 
                The Empire's inhabitants believe that "real" Nilfgaardians are only those born in the heart of the Empire, and not those born in the conquered provinces.</p>

            <h2>Skellige</h2>
            <p>Skellige, commonly referred to as the Skellige Isles or the Isles of Skellige, is an archipelago and one of the Northern Kingdoms. 
                The group of six islands is situated in the Great Sea, off the coast of Cintra and southwest of Cidaris and Verden. It's legendary, famous for the unrivaled corsairs and swift longships that sail many seas.
                Its people are united under the King of the Skellige Isles, who's elected by the jarls of the seven major clans during traditional moots. 
                In practice, however, the kings are from the same clan or at least related.</p>

            <h2>Aedirn</h2>
            <p>
                Aedirn, named after Aedireen, is one of the Northern Kingdoms which lies between Temeria and the massive Mahakam mountains to the west, and the Blue and Fiery Mountains to the east.
                 The kingdom is feuding with Kaedwen about the land called Lormark or Upper Aedirn, depending on the interested party's political persuasion. 
                These lands have been disputed for ages, with Kaedwen laying claim to them as well.</p>
                <img src="images/Witcher_2_Aedirnian_soldiers.webp" alt="Aedirn">


            <h2>Redania</h2> 
            <p>Redania, named after Roeden,[3] is a wealthy realm which profits from trade and agriculture and one of the Four Kingdoms. The capital city of Redania is Tretogor. Other prominent cities are Oxenfurt, with the largest university in the Northern Realms and the free city of Novigrad. 
                The kingdom's neighbors are Kovir, Caingorn, Kaedwen, Aedirn, and Temeria.</p>

            <h2>Horse races</h2>
            <p>Horse Races
                Doing horse races is well worth your time! The saddlebags you earn will let you carry up to 160 items in your inventory, the racing saddles will give your horse more stamina, and with the blinders your horse won't get frightened by monsters so quickly. You will also earn a great deal of money for very little work (the 7th race alone gives you 700 coins and takes only 3 minutes). It's a good way to get some cash early in the game.
                
             </p>
            <p>There are 11 horse races in the game.</p>
            <img class="roach" src="images/imageroach.jpg" alt="roach">
                <p>3 in Velen, 4 in Novigrad, 4 in Skellige.
                It's recommended you do them in the order shown in the video above as some races can only be played if you won certain other races already. The ones in Velen are all at the same location and the track is the exact same. The first 3 of Novigrad are also in the same place, but each one has a different track. Keep talking to the quest giver to ride against the other opponents. 
                The ones on Skellige all have their own unique location.            </p>
            
            
            
                <h2>Gwent</h2>
            <p>Gwent Card Game
               
                
                Gwent is a collectible card game that simulates two armies meeting on the battlefield. You will always find someone willing to play Gwent in the different towns you visit.
                
                For more information, check out these guides:
                <h3>How To Play Gwent</h3>
                <p>
                    Each player must have a full deck for at least one faction to participate in a game of Gwent. This includes a minimum of 22 unit cards and a maximum of 10 special cards. These unit cards can be made up of faction-specific units or Neutral cards, and if a player has more than 22 cards,
                    they may choose to omit them from their deck in favor of drawing a better hand.</p>
                   <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p> The objective of Gwent is fairly simple: ensure that the total strength of your cards on the board is greater than that of your opponent's.
                    At the onset of the game players draw 10 cards from their deck, and may re-draw up to two of those cards (usually those of the weakest power or least strategic value). A coin is flipped to determine who shall go first.         
                    Players place various unit cards in one of three corresponding tiers: Close Combat, Ranged Combat and Siege Combat. Certain cards have bonus abilities, such as adding additional strength to cards in their row or re-drawing a discarded unit.</p>
            
                <h3>Collect Them All</h3>   
                <img src="images/ea357c2b4dae3895bb62c38e04e18480.jpg" alt="image for homepage">

                <p>One of the earliest missions players recieve in Wild Hunt is Collect 'Em All, which is an over-arching quest to find at least one of every Gwent card to complete a deck for every faction.
                    This can be accomplished in several ways - Gwent cards can often be found for sale by various merchants, and many merchats will offer to play a round or two with Geralt. If the Witcher beats the merchant, they will offer him a free Gwent card - though this will only happen once per merchant           
                    There are also players whose proficiency for Gwent is well known, and locating and defeating them become side quests of their own. 
                    These players will yield rare cards upon defeat, usually a Hero card for the faction they favor.</p>
