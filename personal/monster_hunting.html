 <h1>Bestiary</h1>

<h2>Beasts</h2>
<div class="beasts">
     <div class="beast">    
        <img src="images/4e97f08055ae4cedc0783474edc22693.jpg" alt="bear" style="width: 100%;">
    </div>
    <div class="beast">
     <img src="images/Witcher-3-Wolf-Cropped.jpg" alt="wolf" style="width: 100%;">
    </div>
     <div class="beast">
    <img src="images/Gwent_cardart_scoiatael_panther.webp" alt="Panthers" style="width: 100%;" > </div>
    </div>

<p>Bears, wolves, and dogs are the most common beasts gamers can find in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt world, as they are seen in all the significant locations.

They are very similar to the real world animals, as they act the same way.As a result, Geralt has to be careful no matter where he goes.
Some beasts are prone to jump at him when he least expects it. Others have a relatively small area where they appear but they can still cause a lot of trouble for the Witcher.</p>


 <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
 <p> all beasts, they're weak to Beast Oil and the Quen and Igni signs. Once you kill a beast,
you can generally loot items like thier hide, bear, fat, tallow or raw meat. Generally, you'll find beasts near places of power.
It's very hard to deflect a beast attack, so don't count on parrying techniques.</p>



 <h2>Cursed Ones</h2>


<div class="cursed_ones">
 <div class="cursed"> 
    <img src="images/Screenshot-2016-06-01-14.25.27.png" alt="skull" style="width: 100%;">
 </div>

<div class="cursed">
<img src="images/c7da242adf97942e3e901b6053e614e7f9232f2d-1280x720.jpg" alt="werewolf" style="width: 100%;">
</div>
 <div class="cursed">
 <img src="images/baa3bc4dd274072620edc596f97bfbae0f32ccc7_hq.jpg" alt="werebears" style="width: 100%;" >
</div>
</div>

<p>Cursed ones are a class of monster in the bestiary of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its expansions.
Beings attributed to this class are usually created as a result of curse, often from human or humanoid specimens, but not necessarily.</p>


<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<p>Although cursed ones like werewolves, cursed ones and werebears are only susceptible to the kind called Cursed Oil,
it may not be the best coating for one's silver sword. Although all variants of Cursed Oil grant a helpful damage boost against
resilient lycanthrope, players should think about using Beast Oil instead.</p>

<h2>Draconids</h2>


<div class="draconids">
 <div class="draconid">
 <img src="images/the-witcher-3-draconids-wyvern.avif" alt="wyvern" style="width: 100%;">
</div>

 <div class="draconid">
<img src="images/Tw3_contract_dragon.webp" alt="dragon" style="width: 100%;">
</div>

<div class="draconid">
<img src="images/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt.avif" alt="dragon2" style="width: 100%;" >
</div>
 </div>

 <p>While the creature most commonly associated with draconids is dragon, the most populous members of this order are actually the so-called lesser draconids, which include dracolizards (slyzards), forktails and wyverns.
They may be easily confused with dragons, as they share scaly skin or armor made up of bony plates, bat wings, and reptilian maws, legs, and tails.
They are smaller and less intelligent than dragons, and often possess atrophied forelegs, to the point that certain species have none at all. Dragons, in turn, are larger, possess two pairs of well-developed legs,
huge wings and tail, and obvious intelligence. However, mutations from this scheme exist.</p>


<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<p>Draconids are susceptible to Draconid oil, Grapeshot, Golden Oriole, and the sign Aard. During the fight, a well-timed bomb or
burst of Igni can not only bring down a flying Basilisk to ground level, but distract the beast from being able to defend itself properly</p>




<h2>Insectoids</h2>

 <div class="insectiods">
<div class="insectiod">

<img src="images/harrisi.jpg" alt="harrisi" style="width: 100%;">
 </div>
<div class="insectiod">
<img src="images/Sandcrab-witcher-3.webp" alt="sandcrab" style="width: 100%;">
 </div>
<div class="insectoid">
 <img src="images/the-witcher-3-kikimore-stabbed.avif" alt="kikimore" style="width: 100%;" >
 </div>
</div>




<p>Insectoids are larger and more dangerous insects that inhabit almost all the forested areas of Velen, Novigrad, Skellige, and Toussaint in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. They might not be as difficult to destroy as other creatures,
but they still need some precautions not to be overwhelmed while trying to defeat them</p>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
 <p>Armored Arachas are Insectoids and a subspecies of Arachas. Their only weakness is their soft, sensitive abdomen. While the common type hides it under hollow tree stumps,
Armored Arachas have a thick carapace covering all the more delicate parts of their bodies. An Armored Arachas is a true behemoth.</p>


 <h2>Necrophages</h2>
 <div class="necrophages">

<div class="necrophage">
<img src="images/09f04b1f3cb0c0232052da3e4dd96722.jpg" alt="foglet" style="width: 100%;">
</div>
 <div class="necrophage">
 <img src="images/foglet-300px-witcher-3.jpg" alt="foglet2" style="width: 100%;">
</div>

<div class="necrophage">
<img src="images/Witcher-3-Necrophages.avif" alt="kikimore" style="width: 100%;" >
</div>
 </div>







<p>Necrophage is a hypernym used to refer to monsters that generally haunt cemeteries and battlefields, places where dead bodies lay, eating the remains.
Some, however, have decided they have no qualms about being the ones to fill the area with corpses instead of just being carrion crows.</p>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
 <p>Necrophages are accustomed to poisonous vapours. Yet even the most rancid ghouls and graveirs cannot withstand the poison wounds inflicted by a blade coated with Necrophage oil.
 A blade coated with Necrophage oil inflicts increased damage on necrophages.</p>


<h2>Ogriods</h2>



 <div class="ogroids">
    <div class="ogroid">
        <img src="images/witcher-3-troll-up-close.avif" alt="troll" style="width: 100%;">
    </div>
    <div class="ogroid">
        <img src="images/The-Witcher-3-The-Beast-of-Toussaint-1116x628.jpg" alt="ogroid2" style="width: 100%;">
    </div>
    <div class="ogroid">
        <img src="images/245876-w1.webp" alt="icegiant" style="width: 100%;">
    </div>
 </div>


<p>Ogroids are creatures that appear in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt with different forms, 
    yet they all seem to descend from Ogres, which are giant, brutish humanoids praised for their brawn but not their intelligence</p>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
 <p>Like all other Ogroids, they are vulnerable to Ogroid oil and Northern Wind.</p>
